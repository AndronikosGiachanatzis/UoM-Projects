LockersParser:

In a storage there are 'n' number of lockers. Initially all the lockers are closed. We traverse the lockers 'k' times 
starting from the locker 1 and finishing at the locker n. At the j-th pass we change the status of each locker that 
is a multiple of j (if the locker is closed we open it and if it's open we close it).

Write an algorithm writter in C that has as output the status of each foor.
